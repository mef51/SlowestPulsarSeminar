The supernova remnant RCW 103 has been known and observed for several decades but the compact object 1E-1613 at its center has eluded classification due to its very long period Xray variability. This variability either indicated an extremely slow pulsar or some tightly bound binary system with a dim companion that should not have survived the supernova. On June 22 2016 a short x-ray burst was detected by the Swift telescope that gave strong evidence towards the nature of the central object. We'll look at these observations, how they were made, and then discuss the possible classifications. The authors conclude that the object is a magnetar --a highly magnetized pulsar--and so claim to have found the slowest rotating pulsar yet by orders of magnitude.
