Hi everyone, good afternoon.
As some of you know I did my undergrad at the university of Ottawa. My undergrad research wasn't astronomy related; I spent one summer doing computational neuroscience where I built a simulation model in the hopes of studying the nerve damage that can happen in patients with diabetes, and I spent the last year of my undergrad working at the 3MV tandetron, which is used to do extremely sensitive mass spectrometry and mostly radiocarbon dating. Both were interesting projects But I wanted to do an astronomy talk so in the lack of any astronomy related research experience I went to NASA's Facebook page and scrolled through their posts until I found this.

This is the supernova remnant RCW 103. Its age is about 2000 years and it is 3kpc away in our galaxy. It was discovered about 25 years ago and at its center is a compact xray source called 1E 1613 (which I'll just call 1E for now). Long observations made of 1E found that its xray flux varies with a period of 6.67 hours, which is much longer than the periods observed for other compact objects left behind by supernovae. Pulsars normally are observed to have periods of milliseconds to at most minutes, and while the relatively new idea of magnetars was a possible way to explain the extremely slow period there wasn't enough 'confirmed' magnetars for this to be a convincing classification. We'll go into more detail on pulsars and magnetars later; the other possible explanation for this 6.7 hour period is that the object is really a binary system with a companion that occludes the xray source. But a 6.7 hour period means that the binary system is very tightly bound, and on in addition is not very bright, since optical observations don't show a source. If 1E really is a binary system, the companion is a low-mass late type star that had to survive a supernova 2000 years ago. So in light of all this what new evidence would shed more light on how to classify 1E? And what could we observe that will allow us to distinguish between a binary system and an isolated system, and then tell us parameters about that system?

It sounds like a difficult problem but it might not actually need that much to solve it. Ten milliseconds might be enough. On June 22nd the Swift telescope detected a 10ms long burst in xrays coming from RCW103, which is what this paper analyzes. Here is the lightcurve of the burst

Hello everyone thanks for coming.

I'll be talking about a recent observation of an xray burst that led the authors of the paper I chose to conclude that they had found the slowest rotating pulsar seen so far.

[show headline]

I chose this topic not because I'm particularly interested in pulsars, but because I was scrolling through my facebook feed and this headline popped out with the word "slowest". My attention would have just as easily been caught if the word was "fastest" or "weirdest" or some other adjective.

Once I read past the headline and into the paper, it became clear that what the article was presenting as a solid and definite conclusion was really mostly an educated guess. The authors of the paper didn't sound as convinced about what they found as the authors of the article did. Still, the paper was filled with interesting explanations that I thought would make an interesting talk.

So as an outline for my talk I'll be roughly going over these three points:
First
1. What the authors saw
2. How they saw it
3. What they thought about what they saw

On June 22nd the Swift telescope in orbit around Earth detected a burst from the Supernova remnant SNR RCW 10??. The Swift telescope's mission is to detect these kinds of bursts and to do follow up observations of the sources. Its made up of three instruments. First there's the BAT (the Burst Alert Trigger) which looks at about a tenth of the sky triggers on bursts. The purpose of the BAT is mostly to notice when a burst happens and to figure out where it come from. Based on the burst it detected it decides whether or not to turn the telescope around and point the other two instruments at the source. The other two instruments are a X-ray Telescope and a UV/Optical telescope.

urgh this is boring
