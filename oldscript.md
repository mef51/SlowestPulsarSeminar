Hello everyone thanks for coming.

I'll be talking about a recent observation of an xray burst that led the authors of the paper I chose to conclude that they had found the slowest rotating pulsar seen so far.

[show headline]

I chose this topic not because I'm particularly interested in pulsars, but because I was scrolling through my facebook feed and this headline popped out with the word "slowest". My attention would have just as easily been caught if the word was "fastest" or "weirdest" or some other adjective.

Once I read past the headline and into the paper, it became clear that what the article was presenting as a solid and definite conclusion was really mostly an educated guess. The authors of the paper didn't sound as convinced about what they found as the authors of the article did. Still, the paper was filled with interesting explanations that I thought would make an interesting talk.

So as an outline for my talk I'll be roughly going over these three points:
First
1. What the authors saw
2. How they saw it
3. What they thought about what they saw

On June 22nd the Swift telescope in orbit around Earth detected a burst from the Supernova remnant SNR RCW 10??. The Swift telescope's mission is to detect these kinds of bursts and to do follow up observations of the sources. Its made up of three instruments. First there's the BAT (the Burst Alert Trigger) which looks at about a tenth of the sky triggers on bursts. The purpose of the BAT is mostly to notice when a burst happens and to figure out where it come from. Based on the burst it detected it decides whether or not to turn the telescope around and point the other two instruments at the source. The other two instruments are a X-ray Telescope and a UV/Optical telescope.

urgh this is boring
